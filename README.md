# TenderLovingCare DAO <img src="https://chuongtang.github.io/sourceStore/logos/TlcDAO.png" alt="DAO logo" title="tlcDAO logo" height="40" />
a DAO for Tender-Loving-Care people that receive $‚ù§**TLC** whenever they do nice things or being kind to others.

## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-typescript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/main.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on `src/App.tsx`, you'll find the `useMetamask` hook that we use to connect the user's wallet to MetaMask, `useDisconnect` that we use to disconnect it, and `useAddress` to check the user's wallet address once connected.
